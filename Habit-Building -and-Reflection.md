# Habit-Building-and-Reflection-

**1. In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?**  
The most interesting idea was BJ Fogg’s concept of creating new habits by anchoring them to existing ones. For example, doing two pushups right after brushing your teeth. This approach eliminates the need for high motivation or strong willpower and makes habit formation effortless and consistent.

**2. How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.**  
B = MAP means Behavior = Motivation + Ability + Prompt.  
- Motivation: Your desire to do the behavior.  
- Ability: How easy or difficult the behavior is to perform.  
- Prompt: The trigger that reminds you to do the behavior.  
To make new habits easier, reduce difficulty and set reliable prompts instead of relying on motivation.

**3. Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit?**  
Celebrating immediately after completing a habit creates a positive emotional connection. This emotional reward strengthens the neural pathway and reinforces the habit, making it easier to repeat.

**4. In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?**  
The most fascinating idea was the power of compounding improvement. Small daily improvements, like 1% better each day, lead to massive transformation over time. The example of British Cycling’s transformation using marginal gains was inspiring.

**5. What is the book's perspective about Identity?**  
The book explains that habits reflect identity. Focus on becoming the type of person who does the habit, like saying “I am a healthy person” instead of “I want to lose weight.” Identity-based habits are more sustainable.

**6. Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?**  
Make habits easier by following the 2-minute rule, preparing in advance, and modifying your environment to reduce friction. For example, lay out workout clothes or put a book on your pillow.

**7. Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?**  
Make bad habits harder by increasing friction, removing triggers, and using commitment devices. Examples include uninstalling apps or keeping snacks out of reach.

**8. Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?**  
Habit to build: Reading 10 pages daily.  
Steps: Place the book on the desk, choose enjoyable books, read just 10 pages, and track the habit. Celebrate with a smile or journal entry.

**9. Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?**  
Habit to eliminate: Nighttime social media use.  
Steps: Keep the phone outside the bedroom, log out of apps, uninstall them, and reflect on sleep quality. Make the process feel unrewarding.
